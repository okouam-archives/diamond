A simple plugin displays a math question in the form of text while writing a comment

== Description ==

Technology spammers are improving with every passing second, I think. If you leave comments enabled for all, and your site is found spammers, approximately 100-150 spam-comments per hour is provided to you. 

The idea of this plugin is quite simple - to simplify the life of users and make life difficult for spammers as possible. This plugin does not extradite complex images, from which it is simply impossible at times to see something. This plugin gives a simple sentence with a math question like "How much is eight minus three ..." or "How much is six multiplied by five ...". Read the text of the person and understand what he should do a simple operation is not difficult, similar to the CAPTCHA contain numbers and actions that can make life easier for burglars to the same captcha will have trouble. In new versions you can convert sentenses to image and customize it colors for better looking and improve your security!

All spam comments marked as spam automatically, you just have to periodically simply press the button "clean the spam" and this is all.
